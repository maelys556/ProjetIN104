tetris
============

A simple tetris game implemented in C using SDL 2.x.
This is just a toy project to play with and learn SDL 2.x.


Install SDL 2.x ([www.libsdl.org](http://www.libsdl.org/)) in UNIX style; something like `./configure && make && make install`.
Also you'll need:
- `sdl2_ttf`: https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
- `sdl2_gfx`: http://cms.ferzkopp.net/index.php/software/13-sdl-gfx

Use:
----
 - 'make' to launch the tetris game
 - press escape to quit the game
 - press 'r' to reset the game
 - press the left (right) arrow to move the tetromino to the left (right)
 - press the up (down) arrow to turn the tetromino clockwise (counterclockwise) (we are not sure to take the counterclockwise into account)
 - press the spacebar to bring down the tetromino quickly
